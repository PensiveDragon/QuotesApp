# QuotesApp
This is a project I am creating on my own as a challenge.

GOAL: The purpose of this app is to display motivational / famous quotes to the user.   The final app will display 5 quotes a day from its database to the user at a customisable time.

IMPLEMENTED:
Main Viewer loads in 5 quotes from filtered database, can be swiped through.
The quotes can be favourited into a favourites list, where they can then be expanded and viewed collectively.
Favourited quotes can be viewed individually in a specific favourites viewer.
The quotes can be filtered by category in the filter list, limiting which types of quote will be displayed.
Improved gesture detection & swiping functionality.
Standardised quote input system for easy expanding of quote database.
Created external code for auto-formatting new quotes for entry.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
> Customisable notification to prompt the 5 new quotes each day.
System to fully eliminate repeating quotes over a short period of time (however unlikely with a large quote pool).
Advertising integration, monetisation.

IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:
Improved visuals, button design and interactivity.
Revisit quote categorisation, unify categories by broader theme.
'Final' imagery from approved sources safe for public release.
